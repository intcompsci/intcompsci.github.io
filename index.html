<center>Boom then crash, the shattering of glass
I dive to the floor, busting my ass
The hell was that
Was all that I say
Then I see the pool of blood
Then I see my mom she's dead
No emotion in the commotion
I wasn't even sad, even when I learned the bullet was meant for my dad
Vietnam made pops crazy he was already half-dead
So why couldn't that'd be him that got shot in the head?
All the news that fits the print
Momma's death went unreported not a whiff or word or hint
They don't care about us niggers is how my pops explained it
But I didn't know I was a nigga till my dad proclaimed it
Six months later my pops is dead too
Drug-related shots fired his skin turned cold blue
On the news that night the President's wife got a new hair-do
The news guy said "I like it how about you?"
No word about my pops in the Post or on CBS, why was that you ask?
Take a fucking guess
And yeah why is that, that's what politicians should be asking
But who got time for questions when you all skiing up on Aspen?
Broads get gunshots to the head and all y'all serving us is Asprin
My momma so lovely she'd have made your head spin
Level the playing field and y'all will see who'll really win
And yeah I got anger
But I don't let it take me down, my momma taught me better
And she holds me up when I fall down
Rest in peace moms, don't worry about your son
  Some day I'll make you proud because yeah I am the one   - The Get Down
