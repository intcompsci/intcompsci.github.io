      And I don’t know why I’m running
First name like my cousin
First time that we held hands
Thought I was in love 

and I tried to get a move on
Crashing on your fouton
Salad with the crutons
Chop it up like mulan

And I don’t know just what I’m running from like every day
Used think I was in love til it faded away
When you called me on the phone, I loved seeing your face
Used to hate being alone now

Do you remember?
The times we used to share
Do you remember?
The times we used to share (x2)

Back when I made them girls feel like-
